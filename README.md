## Flashcard

See example: `example.txt`! 
A replicate of quizlet but on the command line. Also it works offline! In order to create your own custom flashcards, put a .txt in this directory. In the .txt file. Put your question in one line. Then but the answer to that question in the next line. Put another question in the next line. Then put your answer of that question on the next line. Repeat. The number of lines that have text should be divisble by two (because each question should have an answer). 
Also, if the first character of a line has #, then the python script will ignore that line and go on to the next
